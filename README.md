## _About the Gold-Enigma Repository_

Hello everyone and welcome to my **Gold-Enigma Repository!** I'm about to present to you my _"Portfolio"_ in this repository. So my goal here is to create my first portfolio with a mobile repsonsive layout. I wanted to make sure that everything in my portfolio fits in (**_at the very least_**) an "Iphone X". Here is the link to my mobile responsive [Portfolio](https://shoyu808.github.io/gold-enigma/), so feel free to check it out!

## _How to receive the Gold-Enigma_

Ways on how you can get a copy of the **Gold-Enigma Repository.** Make sure to have a terminal emulator that is compatible with the system you're using whether it be a [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) or [Microsoft PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows). If you don't have a terminal you could use the [Gitbash terminal](https://git-scm.com/downloads) which is the terminal that i'm currently using. You'll also want to setup your ssh keys to protect your local files and to recieve repository on _Github_. [**Guide on setting up ssh keys for Github**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). Next you'll need a text langauge to view the code. The text langauge that i'm currently using is _Vscode_, you could download it in this link here [Vscode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). After you've got everything installed go to the code button on my Repository and copy the ssh key. Then clone the Repository on your terminal with **_git clone_** including my ssh key. Here's an img of my ssh key if you can't find it.

## _Usage on Html, Css, and Bootstrap_

As you could see on the top of my README.md file I have badges shown on what type of language I used the most. By default I've used **HTML** more, but you may be wondering why is didn't I use **CSS** as much? Well obviously my badge gave it away and it is the power of [**_Bootstrap!!!_**](https://getbootstrap.com/) So are you ready to see the wonders of bootstrap? Well I'd thought so, let me explain how I used _Bootstrap_ and applied it to my _HTML_.

The first step is to create an _HTML_ file in your terminal or Vscode. Next you can use the snippet **_html:5_** to setup your _Html_ file on Vscode. It'll make your life easier unless you just like to manually input the code yourself. Here's an image on how your _HTML_ should look.

Next you'll want to add the links of the CSS and Javascript file. Here's the link to the [Bootstrap CSS and Javascript code](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/). I'll also add an image with comments of where to place the _CSS_ and _Javascript_ code so you'll know how to get started.

### **_Important! You always want the script file last in the body section of you HTML file to make bootstrap work. You don't want your tags to get overwritten._**

Now that you're all set to use bootstrap let me demonstrate one of the tools I've used that bootstrap has to offer. One of the tools that I used on bootstrap is their _Grid System_. Their Grid system made it easier to organize your web page thanks to [_Flexbox_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox).The way on how they build their layouts is there 12 column system. Here's an image so you could see an example and I'll explain more.

![Image-of-grid-system](<https://github.com/Shoyu808/gold-enigma/blob/main/blue/images/Screenshot%20(14).png?raw=true>)

In the image above you'll see that they fit nicely into the **Container**. I tried to manually resize the pictures but for some reason the pictures will go out of the grid system so I left the image sizes as is. Here's also the link to the bootstrap [_Grid System_](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/). So the way on how I used their grid system is to create a container with _3 rows_ and in each row it'll have _2 columns_ each. Reason why I set it up like that is so my _Portfolio_ can have a nice vertical layout lined up with each other. This is the image of how my **Portfolio.html** file looks and how I set it up.

![Image-of-portfolio-html](<https://github.com/Shoyu808/gold-enigma/blob/main/blue/images/Screenshot%20(15).png?raw=true>)

I commented on my _HTML_ files if you want to see what other tools I've used from bootstrap if you're curious.

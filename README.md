## *About the Gold-Enigma Repository*

Hello everyone and welcome to my **Gold-Enigma Repository!** I'm about to present to you my *"Portfolio"* in this repository. So my goal here is to create my first portfolio with a mobile repsonsive layout. I wanted to make sure that everything in my portfolio fits in (***at the very least***) an "Iphone X". Here is the link to my mobile responsive [Portfolio](https://shoyu808.github.io/gold-enigma/), so feel free to check it out!

## *How to receive the Gold-Enigma*

Ways on how you can get a copy of the **Gold-Enigma Repository.** Make sure to have a terminal emulator that is compatible with the system you're using whether it be a [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) or [Microsoft PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows). If you don't have a terminal you could use the [Gitbash terminal](https://git-scm.com/downloads) which is the terminal that i'm currently using. You'll also want to setup your ssh keys to protect your local files and to recieve repository on *Github*. [**Guide on setting up ssh keys for Github**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). Next you'll need a text langauge to view the code. The text langauge that i'm currently using is *Vscode*, you could download it in this link here [Vscode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). After you've got everything installed go to the code button on my Repository and copy the ssh key. Then clone the Repository on your terminal with ***git clone*** including my ssh key. Here's an img of my ssh key if you can't find it.

## *Usage on Html, Css, and Bootstrap*

As you could see on the top of my README.md file I have badges shown on what type of language I used the most. By default I've used **HTML** more, but you may be wondering why is didn't I use **CSS** as much? Well obviously my badge gave it away and it is the power of [***Bootstrap!!!***](https://getbootstrap.com/) So are you ready to see the wonders of bootstrap? Well I'd thought so, let me explain how I used *Bootstrap* and applied it to my *HTML*.

The first step is to create an *HTML* file in your terminal or Vscode. Next you can use the snippet ***html:5*** to setup your *Html* file on Vscode. It'll make your life easier unless you just like to manually input the code yourself. Here's an image on how your *HTML* should look.

Next you'll want to add the links of the CSS and Javascript file. Here's the link to the [Bootstrap CSS and Javascript code](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/). I'll also add an image with comments of where to place the *CSS* and *Javascript* code so you'll know how to get started.

####***Important! You always want the script file last in the body section of you HTML file to make bootstrap work. You don't want your tags to get overwritten.***

Now that you're all set to use bootstrap let me demonstrate one of the tools I've used that bootstrap has to offer. One of the tools that I used on bootstrap is their *Grid System*. Their Grid system made it easier to organize your web page thanks to  [*Flexbox*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox).The way on how they build their layouts is there 12 column system. Here's an image so you could see an example and I'll explain more.

In the image above you'll see that they fit nicely into the **Container**. I tried to manually resize the pictures but for some reason the pictures will go out of the grid system so I left the image sizes as is. Here's also the link to the bootstrap [*Grid System*](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/). So the way on how I used their grid system is to create a container with *3 rows* and in each row it'll have *2 columns* each. Reason why I set it up like that is so my *Portfolio* can have a nice vertical layout lined up with each other. This is the image of how my **Portfolio.html** file looks and how I set it up.

I commented on my *HTML* files if you want to see what other tools I've used from bootstrap if you're curious.

## *About the Gold-Enigma Repository*

Hello everyone and welcome to my **Gold-Enigma Repository!** I'm about to present to you my *"Portfolio"* in this repository. So my goal here is to create my first portfolio with a mobile repsonsive layout. I wanted to make sure that everything in my portfolio fits in (***at the very least***) an "Iphone X". Here is the link to my mobile responsive [Portfolio](https://shoyu808.github.io/gold-enigma/), so feel free to check it out!

## *How to receive the Gold-Enigma*

Ways on how you can get a copy of the **Gold-Enigma Repository.** Make sure to have a terminal emulator that is compatible with the system you're using whether it be a [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) or [Microsoft PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows). If you don't have a terminal you could use the [Gitbash terminal](https://git-scm.com/downloads) which is the terminal that i'm currently using. You'll also want to setup your ssh keys to protect your local files and to recieve repository on *Github*. [**Guide on setting up ssh keys for Github**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). Next you'll need a text langauge to view the code. The text langauge that i'm currently using is *Vscode*, you could download it in this link here [Vscode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). After you've got everything installed go to the code button on my Repository and copy the ssh key. Then clone the Repository on your terminal with ***git clone*** including my ssh key. Here's an img of my ssh key if you can't find it.

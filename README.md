## *About the Gold-Enigma Repository*

Hello everyone and welcome to my **Gold-Enigma Repository!** I'm about to present to you my *"Portfolio"* in this repository. So my goal here is to create my first portfolio with a mobile repsonsive layout. I wanted to make sure that everything in my portfolio fits in (***at the very least***) an "Iphone X". Here is the link to my mobile responsive [Portfolio](https://shoyu808.github.io/gold-enigma/), so feel free to check it out!

## *How to receive the Gold-Enigma*

Ways on how you can get a copy of the **Gold-Enigma Repository.** Make sure to have a terminal emulator that is compatible with the system you're using whether it be a [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) or [Microsoft PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows). If you don't have a terminal you could use the [Gitbash terminal](https://git-scm.com/downloads) which is the terminal that i'm currently using. You'll also want to setup your ssh keys to protect your local files and to recieve repository on *Github*. [**Guide on setting up ssh keys for Github**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). Next you'll need a text langauge to view the code. The text langauge that i'm currently using is *Vscode*, you could download it in this link here [Vscode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). After you've got everything installed go to the code button on my Repository and copy the ssh key. Then clone the Repository on your terminal with ***git clone*** including my ssh key. Here's an img of my ssh key if you can't find it.

## *Usage on Html, Css, and Bootstrap*

As you could see on the top of my README.md file I have badges shown on what type of language I used the most. By default I've used **HTML** more, but you may be wondering why is didn't I use **CSS** as much? Well obviously my badge gave it away and it is the power of [***Bootstrap!!!***](https://getbootstrap.com/) So are you ready to see the wonders of bootstrap? Well I'd thought so, let me explain how I used *Bootstrap* and applied it to my *HTML*.

The first step is to create an *HTML* file in your terminal or Vscode. Next you can use the snippet ***html:5*** to setup your *Html* file on Vscode. It'll make your life easier unless you just like to manually input the code yourself. Here's an image on how your *HTML* should look.
